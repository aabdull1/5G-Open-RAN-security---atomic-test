## Week 22: 
06.04.2023 to 19.04.2023

## Tasks: 

- [x] Practical attack with a simple Kubernetes application:
* VM: Devasc
* Scenario: Local atomic attacks, for screenshots please view the ppt file.
* Remote atomic attack couldn’t be established, issue with the password of the Devasc VM. But this remote attack scenario is similar to local because a root password is required for session creation. 

- [x] Working with DN.lab VM:
* Atomic Red Team is installed in atomic VM from DN.lab.
* Near real-time  RIC installation in oran VM is in progress. (no issue yet)


- [x] Report writing:
* Ongoing, 2-3 pages each day (planning)


- [ ] Complete near real-time RIC and install atomic red team in the same VM to run local atomic attack. (20.04.2023)

- [ ] Install non-real-time RIC in oran VM and apply atomic attacks. (22 and 23rd April)

- [ ] Write the report. 

- [ ] Update and organize Gitlab with the previous weeks’ updates.



## Issues:

- SSH creation problem with the root password. Searched on the internet, and found some solution which is supposed to work. But the main problem is with the root password of Devasc VM. As the Kubernetes application is installed in this VM so didn’t try to create an SSH session with another VM.
